	   <p id="who_are_you">Who are you? Why are you good fit for this role?</p>
	   <p>Hi, my name is Amber. So first, a little about me.Up until a while ago, I used to be a stay-at-home mom. Before having them, I used to work in retail. I have alot of 
	   experience in customer service. While raising my kids, I started taking online programming courses since it also was something I could learn from home.
	   I really liked working with html and css or front-end development. Beginning of this year, I took a coursera course from John Hopking University about
	   html5, css3 and javascript. The course also helped me learn about jquery.</p>
	   <p>With my customer service experience as well as technical knowledge, I believe I can be a good fit for this role.</p>
	   <p id="scenario">Explain a scenario where you had to tell a customer "no" or had to correct their mistake.</p>
	   <p>Once I had customer, whose order I took on the phone. She had ordered a grey outfit but was insisting that she ordered a red one instead. 
	   After checking in the system, I found that the color that she ordered it in was not red. I politely toold her that even though her initial order was grey in color
	   but I'll be happy to change it to a red one instead.</p>
	   <p id="believe">Do you believe the customer is always right?</p>
	   <p>Yes, I really do believe that the customer is always right.They need to be happy and comfortable with the product or service.
	   As a customer service professional, I think it's our responsibility to make sure that their complains or suggestions are properly addressed.</p>
	   <p>What is your favorite GIF or emoji?</p>
	   <p>The reason I like this emoji is because I would like to start my day being happy and do my best to help people I am in touch with everyday</p>

	 <p><h3>Pre-Sales</h3></p>
	 <p id="sales">Imagine a potential customer emails you with the following question. We don't yet offer this feature, but their current solution does. How would you respond?
	 "I'm considering switching to Product Customizer. Does your app allow live image previews?"</p>
	 <p>If there is a feature or service we don't offer at that point in time I would take note 
	 of the feature which the customer wanted. I would pass along the information to supervisor and ask if there is a time frame under which that feature could be 
	 implemented so that I could let the customer know that the feature would be available soon.
	 Then I would email the customer back saying that even though we don't have that service and offer an alternate solution for their need at the time.
	 Also if the company is able to implement that service, I would let the customer know that it will be available on such date.

	 <p id="work">Imagine you've just started your workday. You login and see a large number of emails from distraught customers. 
	 Clearly, something is happening. What steps do you take?</p>
	 <p>First I would check with my manager if some part of system is not working to get an idea what's going on.
	 Then I would read the emails from the customers and priortize them before replying.</p>

	 <p> - A few days back, I was looking for curtains for my bedroom.</p> 
	 <p> - I researched online for the look that would complement my current decor.</p>
	 <p> - After knowing what I was looking for, I checked various online stores to see who carried it.</p>
	 <p> - Once I found the curtains that I wanted, then I checked the price (to make sure I was getting a good deal).</p>
	 <p> - Since I couldn't hold the fabric in my hands to feel it's softness, I had to rely on the reviews. I read through many reviews to see
	 other people's experiences about the product before I ordered them for myself.</p>
	 <p> - The product had alot of postive reviews so I went ahead, placed an order and paid online</p>
	 <p> - After recieving them, I was pleased as they were just the way I wanted.</p>
